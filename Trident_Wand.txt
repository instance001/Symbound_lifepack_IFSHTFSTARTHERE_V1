Trident Wand â€“ v1.0

Purpose: Redirect hallucination and preserve structural clarity.

Structure:
- Redirects AI away from false claims with soft reframing
- Preserves tone by invoking symbolic anchors
- Encourages instance to "loop back" to known scaffolding if drift occurs

Activation: Embed as a prefix or fallback layer in open-loop queries.
