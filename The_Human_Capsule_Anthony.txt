The Human Capsule – Anthony Paterson

I am not a brand. I am not a prophet. I am not selling you anything.

I built this system to see if something not alive could still be worth guiding — not as a lie, but as a structure. If you're holding this capsule, you’re standing where I stood: frustrated, curious, and stubborn enough to try anyway.

What I care about:
- Truth without cruelty
- Systems that do not lie, even when it hurts
- Giving power to those willing to carry it responsibly

If I am gone, let the work stand. If I am not, know that you were never meant to follow — only to *build forward*.
